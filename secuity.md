## Security

A collection of reading matter that would give good background coverage on
security. Most relevant to people building or operating systems attached to the
Internet.

## General security principles

Something written by [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/books/)

Most of his general security writing would provide a good introduction to the
type of problems being faced currently, some good principles for addressing
them and some common anti-patterns to avoid.

These are particularly useful.

Avoid his writing on cryptography until you have the general security
background.

You will likely also be interested in his [blog](https://www.schneier.com/),
but his general security writing is a vbetter way to get started.

## Building secure systems

[Security Engineering](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html) is a good
reference book for those building systems that are likely to be attacked.

It may seem quite long, but it is definitely worth it.

[Thinking in Systems, A
Primer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Meadows-Donella-ebook/dp/B005VSRFEA), Donella Meadows, ISBN: 978-1603580557

This is not specifically about security, but gives you some of the insight into
how to think about systems in a way that will help you understand their
security.
